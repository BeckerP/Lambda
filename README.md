Team Lambda:

To: FogCreek software - my ownership was in the Customer application and the main selection activity.  Within the customer activity I created the fragments for the main portions (menu's, ordering) excluding the Game fragment and the Chat (Jon Tran) Fragment.

Caleb did the backend.


Small Project made in CSCE4444 at UNT with Caleb Rogers, Jon Tran, Sean and Jacob.


Goals:

Going to refactor most of the code and hopefully port it to Ruby (over PHP) for the backend [eventually].
Fix the dialog box in Customer Tab.
Re-make the Admin Page with Ruby/CSS once I learn it.

Delete the Waitress/Cook applications or just the Waitress application.

End goal is to make this a cash-register/POS application for fun.
