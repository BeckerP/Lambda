Lambda

Small Project made in CSCE4444 at UNT with Caleb Rogers, Jon Tran, and a few others.

Goals:

Going to refactor most of the code and hopefully port it to Ruby (over PHP) for the backend [eventually].
Fix the dialog box in Customer Tab.
Re-make the Admin Page with Ruby/CSS

Delete the Waitress/Cook applications or just the Waitress application.

End goal is to make this a cash-register/POS application.
